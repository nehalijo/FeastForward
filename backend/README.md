### Project Description
Our website connects people with surplus food to those in need by enabling easy food donations after events or gatherings. It provides a simple platform for donors to list available food and for recipients to find and collect it. This helps reduce food waste while feeding the hungry in local communities.

### The Problem Statement
Food waste and hunger coexist due to the lack of an easy way to donate surplus food. Our website connects donors with those in need, reducing waste and feeding communities.

### The Solution
We provide a simple platform where people can easily donate surplus food and connect with those in need. Donors list available food; recipients can find and collect it, ensuring less waste and more meals for the hungry.
